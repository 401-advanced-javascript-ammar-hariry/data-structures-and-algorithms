# Linked List
this code will create a **Linked List**, and method to add a **Node** to the **Linked List**, and method to merge two **Linked Lists**.

## Challenge
- create method to merge two **Linked Lists**.

## Approach & Efficiency
- create a method that takes two parameters and return a new **Linked List** that consist of the two **Linked List** that I inserted .

- Big O for ``append method`` is O(1): it's check once and inserting the value to the end of the **Linked List**
- Big O for  ``mergeLists method`` for both space and time is O(n): it's go thow the two **Linked List** once, and use ``append method`` inside it.
