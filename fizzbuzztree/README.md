# FizzBuzzTree:
-  create a **FizzBuzzTree** function that takes tree as an argument and determine its value if are divisible by 3, 5 or both.

## Challenge
-  Create  a function called **FizzBuzzTree** which takes a tree as an argument, , determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Create  a function called **FizzBuzzTree** will take argument tree.
- it will walk throw the tree values using preorder trivals.
- if the value % 3 === 0 change it to 'fizz'
- if the value % 5 === 0 change it to 'buzz'
- if the value is divisible by 3 and 5 change it to 'fizzbuzz'
- if the value is not divisible by 3 or 5 change its type to string.
- return the new tree

#### FizzBuzzTree:
- Big O (for time ):  is O(n): becuse it depend on the number of the nodes
- Big O  (for space):  is o(h): becuse it depend on the height of tree
