# multi Bracket Validation
create a function that takes a string as an argument it will return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:
- Round Brackets : ()
- Square Brackets : []
- Curly Brackets : {}

## Challenge
- create function takes a string as an argument.
- this function will check the brackets
- return true if the brackets balanced and false if it is not


## Approach & Efficiency
- using a for loop to  iterate the string and check for the brackets, 
- if statements with counters to count the number closed and open brackets
- if statement the counts is balanced it will return true and return false is it is not

## BigO:
the big for space and time it O(n) : because of using for loop to iterate the string.
