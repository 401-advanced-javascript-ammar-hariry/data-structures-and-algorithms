# repeated-word

#  repeated-word:
-  create a **repeated-word** function that takes lengthy string parameter  and returns the first repeated word

## Challenge
-  Create  a function called **epeated-word** which takes a lengthy string paramete, and returns the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Create  a function called **repeated-word** will take argument lenggthy string.
- using slice to convert the string ti an array;
- for loop to iterate in the array 
- while loop to compare the values of an array.
- once the if statement  be correct once, it will return the value(word) and go out the loop
- if there is no reapeted words will return that
