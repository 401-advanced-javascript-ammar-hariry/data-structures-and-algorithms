### Challenge Summary
crear ``InterSection()`` function to finde the repated values in both trees.

### Challenge Description
- create ``InterSection()`` function that takes two binary tree parameters. and return a set of values found in both trees.

### Approach & Efficiency
i build InterSection() function that take two tree as inputs and return the repeated values between them , i reach thad by save the first tree values in an array then walk through the other array while i check if the current node exist in the first tree array .

### Big O notation
the bigO for (space and time) is O(n) sice I used preOrder to go throgh the bothe trees.
