# Stack and Queues:
this code will Create **AnimalShelter** class which holds only **dogs** and **cats**. The shelter operates using a **first-in, first-out** (which is a queue) approach.
## Challenge
- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
## Approach & Efficiency
- create **AnimalShelter** class with two properties (back and front) to make it esier for me to add and romove when I create **enqueue** and **dequeue** methods that use **first-in, first-out** approach.

#### Queue:
- Big O (for time and space): for ``enqueue method`` is O(1): it's check the front once and inserting the value to the front of **Queue**
- Big O  (for time and space): for ``dequeue method`` is o(1): i just check the front once and make the next the new front
