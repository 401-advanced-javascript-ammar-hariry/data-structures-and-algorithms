# left-join
this code will create a fuunction  that apply **LEFT JOIN** logic on two **hash-tables** and returns structure with a proper values. 

## Challenge
- create a function ``leftJoin()`` that takes two **hash-tables** as parameters and returns a strucure with kyes and values based on **LEFT JOIN** logic;  

## Approach & Efficiency
- create ``leftJoin()`` that takes two **hash-tables** as parameters 
- loop throgh both tables.
- push the values inside an array based on the **LEFT JOIN** logic


### Big O:
- Big O  (for time): for ``leftJoin()``  is O(n) because I used for loop to iterate inside the hash-table array once
