# Linked List
this code will create a **Linked List**, and method to add a **Node** to the **Linked List**, and method to search through the **Linked List** for a  value  whether this value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list and return aboolean result. and method to represent the node inside the **linked list** (as an array).
add two new methods one to insert a new value to the **linked list**  before an exists value and the other to insert a new value to the **linked list** after an exists value.
## Challenge
- create method  to search through the **Linked List** for a  value  whether this value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list and return aboolean result.
- create method to insert a new value to the **linked list**  before an exists value
- create method to insert a new value to the **linked list** after an exists value.
## Approach & Efficiency
- create a **linked list** have a methods to add nodes.
- create another method to search in the **linked list** using while loop.
- create two methods to insert new value before or after an exists value using while loop and if statement. 

- Big O for ``append method`` is O(1).
- Big O for ``include method`` is o(n).
- Big O for ``tostring method`` is o(n).
- Big O for ``insertAfter method`` is O(1).
- Big O for ``insertBefore method`` is O(1).
