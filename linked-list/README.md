# Linked List
this code will create a **Linked List**, and method to add a **Node** to the **Linked List**, and method to search through the **Linked List** for a  value  whether this value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list and return aboolean result. and method to represent the node inside the **linked list** (as an array).
## Challenge
create method method to search through the **Linked List** for a  value  whether this value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list and return aboolean result.
## Approach & Efficiency
- create a **linked list** have a methods to add nodes.
- create another method to search in the **linked list** using while loop.
- Big O: it's o(n).
